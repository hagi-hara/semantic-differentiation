Semantic Differentiation of Early Object Words
====

## Overview
This repository includes the experimental stimuli, stan codes, graphing codes, and dataset for the following paper:

Hagihara, H., Yamamoto, H., Moriguchi, Y., & Sakagami, M. (2022). When “shoe” becomes free from “putting on”: The link between early meanings of object words and object-specific actions. *Cognition*, *226*, 105177. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2022.105177

## Description
This repository consists of three folders, "**ExperimentalStimuli**," "**Study1**," and "**Study2**." The folders "Study1" and "Study2" correspond to codes for the cross-sectional study (Study 1), and codes longitudinal study (Study 2), respectively. Each of "Study1" or "study2" contains a csv file "data\_(study name).csv_", R codes, and a folder "Models", which contains Stan codes.

Here we show a simple folder structure.

In each study, we conducted mainly three kinds of analyses; "Analysis 1", "Analysis 2", and "Analysis 3" in the main text. Each analysis corresponds to R codes starting with the same name.

 In Study 1, we conducted a series of model selections while slightly changing each of the response variables or explanatory variables. In Analysis 1 and Analysis 2, the naming of the R code basically follows the rule "(analysis name)\_(response variable)\_(explanatory variable).R". When the response variable was preference looking, there were cases where the looking time proportion to the correct stimulus is treated as binary or continuous variables.

  In Study 2, the naming of the R code basically follows the rule "(analysis name)\_(response variable).R". As written in the paper, the binarized looking time proportion was treated as response variables.
